# codelouisville_fewd_project
Final project for code louisville's front-end-web-development

This phot gallery builds on load by taking an array of file names from galleryData.js and building each gallery
it uses the background color contained in the file name of each image when creating the div

this allows easy addition of new phots by simply adding its file name to the array uploading the jpeg to /imgs
