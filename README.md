# codelouisville_fewd_project
Final project for code louisville's front-end-web-development

This photo gallery builds on load by taking an array of file names from galleryData.js and building each DIV in turn.

The photo's cateogry (Accessories, shoes, jewelry, homegoods) and background color are contained in its filename. This makes accomodating future shots as easy as saving the image w/ the details in its file name, adding it to the array in galleryData.js, and uploading the shot to the server.
